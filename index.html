                    <p>I am a creative and designer with extensive UX and UI, film production, marketing and research experience.   
                        I enjoy design because it allows for the culmination of all of my areas of expertise. 
                        I take a human-centered approach to solving all user problems.
                        I have had the experience of traveling to places such as Berlin, Dubai, Paris, Turkey, and Barcelona where I have witnessed a plethora of cultures and design thinking.
                        I channel all of my understandings into each new project.
                        I specialize in ux research and project management and enjoy solving user problems that prevent users from effortlessly navigating the world.
